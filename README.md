# salesforce-code
Storing common and useful Apex code for Salesforce here. Some LWC templates may come next along with some documentation about getting Salesforce + Git + VSC setup to start development.

## Get Started
These are the prerequisites and steps to take to get started.

### Software Prerequisite
These software tools need to be installed on your computer.
1. [Salesforce CLI (sfdx) tool](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli)
2. A Git repository
3. [Visual Studio Code + all the Salesforce extensions installed](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/)

### Steps for New Git Repo and VSC Project
Here's what to do when starting from scratch with no Git repo and no VSC project. These steps came from [https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models/](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models/) - these are just a few tweaks I like to make.
1. Create a new repository and clone it into a directory on your computer.
2. Open the repo directory in VSC.
3. Run *SFDX: Create Project with Manifest* from the VSC command palette. Select standard for the template and name the project the exact same as the directory name you created for the Git repo. This will add the the Salesforce project structure to the repo.
