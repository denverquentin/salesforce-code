# Recommended Salesforce DevOps Process from UST
This is the place to find our recommendations for a great Salesforce development process. Our process is a collection of best practices and lessons learned for Salesforce development, deployment and support.

This DevOps process works good for large teams with a mix of developer levels and is a great starting point for onboarding new developers. These documents should take a half day or less to read and get a Salesforce project setup for development.

The developer wiki contains important information about:

[Git Branch Model & Flow](Salesforce-Git-Branching-Model.md)

[Setup Steps for Salesforce Development](Salesforce-Development-Setup.md)

[Salesforce Development Flow](Salesforce-Development-Flow.md)

[Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery](Salesforce-CICD-Process.md)

[Salesforce Development Standards](Salesforce-Development-Standards.md)


## Contribute
Application documentation will only be as good as the contributions made to it. Please document everything that you think will be helpful or any changes to your process to keep this up to date. And it's best to assume that anyone reading this wiki is new to the project so explain and expand upon as much as you can.
